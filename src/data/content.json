    "title": "I believe that food is an entry point to create positive change.",
    "content": "My love for all things tasty began while I was tucked away in restaurant kitchens and back booths after school and in between daycare while my mom waited tables, and was cemented by helping my dad cook cornbread for the holidays. Since then, I have hosted cooking classes, and empowered community leaders to become food educators. Beyond the plate, my focus extends to breaking down barriers to food access. I have a master's degree in public health and city planning, and consult with agencies, nonprofits, and developers. I champion equitable food policies, conduct needs assessments, and design evaluations for farm-to-school programs. I thrive in spaces where community members share their passions and concerns. Join me in exploring the rich intersection of Food and Culture through our monthly newsletter, The Nosh."
